title: Chicago Transportation Network Providers - Vehicles
organization: City of Chicago
notes: All vehicles reported by Transportation Network Providers (sometimes called rideshare companies) to the City of Chicago as part of routine reporting required by ordinance. Inclusion of a vehicle in a monthly report indicates that the vehicle was eligible for trips in Chicago in that month for at least one day, regardless of whether it actually provided any rides. If a vehicle is eligible in multiple months, which is common, it will have records in each of these reporting months.
